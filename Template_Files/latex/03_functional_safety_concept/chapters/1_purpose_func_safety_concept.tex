\chapter{Purpose of the Functional Safety Concept}
\label{ch:purpose}

% Instructions: Answer what is the purpose of a functional safety concept?

The purpose of the functional safety concept is to look at the general
functionality of the lane assistance item and define the functional
safety requirements. It is also worth noting that the functional requirements
definition should be done at a higher abstraction level, without going deep
into technical details.
According to the ISO 26262~\cite{iso26262} these functional safety requirements
will then be refined to the technical safety requirements.
