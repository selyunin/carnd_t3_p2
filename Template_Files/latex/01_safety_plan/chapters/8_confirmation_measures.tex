A safety plan could have other sections that we are not including here. For
example, a safety plan would probably contain a complete project schedule.

There might also be a "Supporting Process Management" section that would cover
"Part 8: Supporting Processes" of the ISO 26262 functional safety standard.
This would include descriptions of how the company handles requirements
management, change management, configuration management, documentation
management, and software tool usage and confidence.

Similarly, a confirmation measures section would go into more detail about how
each confirmation will be carried out.
