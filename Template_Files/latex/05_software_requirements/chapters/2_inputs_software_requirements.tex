\chapter{Inputs to the Software Requirements and Architecture Document}
\label{ch:inputs}

% Instructions:
 
% REQUIRED:
% You are only required to develop this document for the LDW (lane departure warning)
% amplitude malfunction. So here, provide the technical safety requirements for the LDW
% amplitude malfunction as well as the refined system architecture diagram from the
% technical safety concept.
 
% OPTIONAL:
% Expand this document to include software safety requirements for the LDW frequency
% malfunction as well. Go even further and document software safety requirements for the
% Lane Keeping Assistance (LKA) function as well.


\section{Technical safety requirements}

Technical Safety Requirements related to Functional Safety Requirement 01-01 are
presented in Table~\ref{tab:tr0101}
