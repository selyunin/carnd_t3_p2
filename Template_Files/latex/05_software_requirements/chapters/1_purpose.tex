\chapter{Purpose of the Software Safety Requirements and Architecture}
\label{ch:purpose}

% Instructions: Answer what is the purpose of this document?

ISO 26262~\cite{iso26262} suggests to use a V-model for the software
product development lifecycle.
The main steps of the \textbf{V} model for software development can
be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Specification of software safety requirements
  \item Software architectural design
  \item Software unit design and implementation
  \item Software unit testing
  \item Software integration and testing
  \item Verification of software safety requirements
\end{itemize}

Software Safety Requirements come from Technical Safety Requirements, 
and in addition should cover the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Maintaining or reaching a safe state
  \item Detecting, indicating, and handling software and hardwar faults
\end{itemize}

In order to facilitate ISO 26262 compliance of a software system,
we need to approach software development systematically:
i.e. first define the software requirements, then devise a software
architecture, and then implement a system based on the pre-defined
requirements and architecture.
