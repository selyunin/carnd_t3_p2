\label{ch:safety_lifecycle_tailoring}

% Instructions:
% Describe which phases of the safety lifecycle are in scope and which are out of scope for
% this particular project. Hint: See the Intro section of this document


In this project, the following safety lifecycle phases are in scope:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Concept phase:} 
	defining the safety concept and the corresponding safety requirements 
  \item \textbf{Product Development at the System Level:}
	identifying functional components of the system with a dedicated
	functionality boundaries between these components
  \item \textbf{Product Development at the Software Level:}
	defining the software components of the system with, defining the
	functionality of these components and means of interactions
	between the components.
\end{itemize}

The following phases are out of scope:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Product Development at the Hardware Level:} 
	defining hardware components, parts selection, PCB design, 
	hardware communication interfaces
  \item \textbf{Production and Operation}
	identifying how the product should be maintained during use
\end{itemize}
