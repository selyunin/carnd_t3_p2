\section{Goals}
% Instructions:
% Describe the major goal of this project; 
% what are we trying to accomplish by analyzing 
% the lane assistance functions with ISO 26262?

The goal of the project is to identify functional safety requirements, safety
goals and propose means to achieve these safety goals using system's
engineering.

In general, this is done by identifying hazardous situations, and finding ways
to reduce the risk of these hazards to the levels acceptable by society.

By analyzing the Lane Assistance function with ISO 26262 we are trying to come
up with the design of a system, using means and guidelines provided by the
standard, such that the system is safe for humans to use, and would not create
unnecessary dangerous situation, while using the system.

The goal of this project can then be summarized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Identify hazards in a Lane Assistance item
	that could cause physical injury or damage to a person's health
  \item Evaluate the risk of the hazardous situation 
  \item Using systems engineering, propose means to prevent accidents from occurring 
	by lowering risk to reasonable levels. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Measures}
% Instructions:
% Fill in who will be responsible for each measure or activity. 
% Hint: The lesson on Safety Management Roles and Responsibilities.
% The options are:
% All Team Members
% Safety Manager
% Project Manager
% Safety Auditor
% Safety Assessor

Table~\ref{tab:measures} defines the following measures to maintain
the safety standard defined by the ISO 26262.

The key team members in the Lane Assistance project and their the main
responsibilities are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Project Manager
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Overall project management
	\item Acquires and allocates resources needed for the functional safety activities
	\item Appoints safety manager or might act as safety manager
  \end{itemize}
  \item Safety Manager
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Planning, coordinating and documenting of the development phase of the safety lifecycle
	\item Tailors the safety lifecycle
	\item Maintains the safety plan
	\item Monitors progress against the safety plan
	\item Performs pre-audits before the safety auditor
  \end{itemize}
  \item Safety Engineer
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Product development
	\item Integration
	\item Testing at the hardware, software and system levels
  \end{itemize}
  \item Safety Auditor
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Ensures that the design and production implementation conform to the safety plan and ISO 26262.
	\item Must be independent from the team developing the project
  \end{itemize}
  \item Safety Assessor
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Independent judgement as to whether functional safety is being achieved via a functional safety assessment
	\item Must be independent from the team developing the project
  \end{itemize}
  \item Test Manager
  \begin{itemize}
	\item Plans testing activities
	\item Coordinates testing to show that the vehicle system works correctly
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
