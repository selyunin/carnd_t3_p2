To support development, production, and integration of safe systems, 
we put safety the highest priority over competing constraints (e.g. cost, productivity), 
and promote the following safety principles:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{High priority:} safety has the highest priority among competing
	constraints like cost and productivity
  \item \textbf{Accountability:} our processes ensure accountability such that design
	decisions are traceable back to the people and teams who made the decisions
  \item \textbf{Rewards:} our organization motivates and supports the achievement
	of functional safety
  \item \textbf{Penalties:} our organization penalizes shortcuts that
	jeopardize safety or quality
  \item \textbf{Independence:} design teams are independent from the teams who audit the work
  \item \textbf{Well defined processes:} our company clearly defines design and management
	processes
  \item \textbf{Resources:} projects have necessary resources including people
	with appropriate skills
  \item \textbf{Diversity:} intellectual diversity is sought after, valued and
	integrated into processes
  \item \textbf{Communication:} communication channels encourage disclosure of
	problems
\end{itemize}

Our Organization has a quality management system in place that complies
with quality management standards IATF 16949.
