% Instructions: Answer what is the purpose of a technical safety concept?

The purpose of the technical safety concept is to refine the previously defined
functional safety requirements to the hardware and software architecture to
take into account technical details, system limitations, and architecture.

According to the ISO 26262~\cite{iso26262} the technical safety concept is part
of the product development phase.

The main tasks of technical safety concept include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Turning functional safety requirements into technical safety requirements
  \item Allocating technical safety requirements to the system architecture
\end{itemize}
